## Semantic Versioning 

The project will use semantic versioning for it's tagging. [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format is **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, for example, `1.0.1` 

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions 
to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
